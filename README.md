SoloLa!
================================================================================

SoloLa! is an automatic system for transcribing the electric guitar solo part in
music mixture into sheet music. The system comprises of the following algorithms:

0. Tempo detection
1. Monaural source separation
2. Melody extraction
3. Note tracking 
4. Expression style recognition
5. Fingering arrangement
